# Diff AutoClose for VS Code

Welcome to the "Diff AutoClose" extension for Visual Studio Code! This extension enhances your workflow by automatically closing the diff editor tabs when they lose focus, keeping your workspace clean and organized.
## Features

Diff AutoClose cleanly and efficiently manages open diff tabs in your workspace by auto-closing them once they are no longer in focus. This helps in maintaining a clutter-free editor interface, especially useful when working with multiple changes and comparisons.

- **Automatic Closing**: Diffs are auto-closed once they lose focus, helping you keep only the relevant files open.
- **Customizable Behavior**: Configure the extension to suit your workflow, deciding when and which diffs should auto-close.

> **Tip**: This useful feature helps you to avoid manually closing each diff tab and focus more on your code.
## Requirements

There are no specific requirements or dependencies for using Diff AutoClose. Just install it from the Visual Studio Marketplace and it's ready to use.
